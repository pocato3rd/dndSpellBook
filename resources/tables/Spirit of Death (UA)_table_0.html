     Paralyzing Fear (1/Day).
    </em>
   </strong>
   The reaper attempts to instill fear into the haunted creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of the reaper for 1 minute. While frightened this way, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, or immediately after it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.
